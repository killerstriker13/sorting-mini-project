# sorting-mini-project
As the name suggests, it's our mini-project for the sorting lab.

This is the sorting mini project which includes four types of sort and test cases for them. It has Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort and ... sort. I used the lab I had with Alexander for Merge Sort. I did the QuickSort lab again on my own and used that. I used chatGPT to implement my own sort.
