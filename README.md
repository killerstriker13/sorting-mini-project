# sorting-mini-project
As the name suggests, it's our mini-project for the sorting lab.

### Author: Shibam Mukhopadhyay
This is the sorting mini project which includes four types of sort and test cases for them. It has Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort and Intro Sort. I used the lab I had with Alexander for Merge Sort. I did the QuickSort lab again on my own and used that. I used chatGPT to implement my own sort. 

MukhopadhyayShibamSort was created by asking ChatGPT several prompts. At first I just wanted to see what kind of sorts it would give me. It listed out quite a few: Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Heap Sort, Counting Sort, Radix Sort, Bubble Sort, and Shell Sort. Then I asked it for sorts with complexity O(n^2) as per the part five prompt which gave me Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort. But then I realized that the rubric asks for O(nlogn) sorts. So I asked it for that and it listed down Merge Sort Quick Sort Heap Sort and Tim Sort. I felt like since this is the Heap Sort was the first thing that was different from other sorts, many other people would have also gotten that. So I decided to prompt it one more time and this time it gave me an entirely new list. Out of which I chose intro sort since it seemed interesting. Having a sort that switches between sorts sounded fun. I asked ChatGPT for Java code for arrays with Intro Sort and then worked further on it with our Sorter Interface.
